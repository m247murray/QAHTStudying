        <li><a href="#">Daily Calendar Template</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>First-Year Dictionary</h2>
        <p>A dictionary of terms commonly used at Queen's.</p>
        
        <h3>Bell Curve</h2>
        <p>A bell curve is a way of grading that uses a normal distribution to show how marks are spread out in a class. It's called a bell curve because the distribution of marks looks like a bell-shaped curve when plotted on a graph.</p>
        
        <h3>Seminar</h2>
        <p>A seminar on a particular topic related to your field of study.</p>
        
        <h3>Thesis</h2>
        <p>A thesis is a document written by a student as part of their academic degree program. It presents an original research project and findings in a specific field of study. A thesis is typically longer and more detailed than a regular research paper, and it usually requires months or even years of research and writing. The purpose of a thesis is to demonstrate the student's mastery of their subject area and ability to contribute original knowledge to their field.</p>
        <h3>Net-ID</h3>
        <p>Your Net-ID is a combination of your initials and some numbers,
            like “20ABC2” for example. This is also the beginning of your Queen’s email
            (20abc2@queensu.ca). You’ll use this to login to SOLUS, OnQ, and other
            websites. You will also need to write it on most of your exams.
            </p>
        <h3>Student Number</h3>
        <p>Student Number: An 8 digit number that is unique to you! You’ll need this for
            exams, to get packages from the front desk, and some other stuff here and
            there. This number is also on your Student ID Card. Probably a good idea to
            memorize this number now, because you never know when you’ll need it.</p>
        <h3>OnQ</h3>
        <p>Like Google Classroom, but on steroids. OnQ is like the hub for anything
            class-related. Here you’ll find class material like lecture slides, quizzes,
            assignment dropboxes, and any online homeworks (usually done through
            a program called “Mastering”). OnQ is pretty easy to navigate, and you’ll
            definitely get familiar with it quickly. You’ll need your Net-ID and the password
            you make to login, which you can do at onq.queensu.ca. </p>
        <h3>SOLUS</h3>
        <p> Home of your course schedule, exam schedule, financial information,
            discipline selection, etc., etc. To access SOLUS, go to my.queensu.ca, then
            click the grey “SOLUS” button on the top left. You’ll use the same Net-ID and
            password to log in as for OnQ.</p>
