    <h1>Study Methods</h1>
    <p>There are many different study methods that can help you learn and retain information more effectively. Here are three popular techniques:</p>
    
    <h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>
    <p>The Feynman Technique is a method for learning and understanding complex concepts. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose a concept you want to learn.</li>
      <li>Explain the concept in simple language, as if you were teaching it to a child.</li>
      <li>Identify any gaps in your understanding and go back to the source material to fill them in.</li>
      <li>Simplify your explanation further and repeat the process until you can explain the concept clearly and concisely.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>The Pomodoro Method</h2>
    <p>The Pomodoro Method is a time management technique that can help you stay focused and productive while studying. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose a task you want to work on.</li>
      <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Work on the task without any distractions until the timer goes off.</li>
      <li>Take a short break (5-10 minutes) and then start another 25-minute work session.</li>
      <li>After four work sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes) before starting the cycle again.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Mind Mapping</h2>
    <p>Mind Mapping is a visual method for organizing and connecting information. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with a central idea or topic and write it down in the center of a piece of paper.</li>
      <li>Branch out from the center with subtopics or related ideas, connecting them to the central topic with lines.</li>
      <li>Add more subtopics or details to each branch, connecting them to the appropriate subtopic with lines.</li>
      <li>Use colors, images, and symbols to make the mind map more visually engaging and memorable.</li>
    </ol>
